          <p>
            I have found many articles citing the fact that children who are
            taught about neuroplasticity do better in school overall. I
            didn&rsquo;t find many articles explaining scientifically exactly
            why that is, so I&rsquo;m assuming that it comes down to this:
            Children who believe that their brains are not static, and can grow
            and learn new skills, will do so. Or as Lisa Lionheart says
            &ldquo;If you believe in yourself, you can achieve anything&rdquo;.

              neuroplasticity?</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            According to the article &ldquo;How to rewire your brain with
            neuroplasticity training&rdquo; (find article
            <a href="https://www.betterup.com/blog/what-is-neuroplasticity"
              >here</a
            >), Neuroplasticity training includes doing brain training &nbsp;
            games, being well rested, exercising regularly, eating right, and
            having a good social life. Luckily those activities are the first
            recommended cure for pretty much all mental and physical health
            problems so I don&rsquo;t have to change too much.
          </p>
          <p>
            I didn&rsquo;t know about the neuroplasticity term at the time, but
            I learned a few years ago about how your brain will make stronger
            neural pathways to certain things the more you do/think about the
            thing. Learning about it helped in the process of overcoming
            debilitating depression, because, to summarize, bad thoughts become
            easier and more comforting to go to the more you go to them. But it
            doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re true or permanent, it just means
            the neural pathway to them is really strong. I suppose
            Neuroplasticity is a double edged sword in that way.
          </p>
          <p>
            But you can weaken those pathways too through not thinking or doing
            those things. I don&rsquo;t have a good memory of how I did it but
            it was probably a mix of trying to learn guitar, medication, and
            distracting myself with TV and friends.

            This was the first song I learned to play properly on guitar.
            It&rsquo;s pretty easy if you just learn the finger position of the
            chords:

            <strong>Growth Mindset</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            A growth mindset is understanding that your abilities and talents
            are not fixed, and can be improved over time through hard work and
            effort. It&rsquo;s relevant &nbsp;because this course is very
            intense, so we need to have a growth mindset in order to keep on top
            of things.

            I was surprised that according to these articles, the majority of
            people think they have finished learning and have filled their brain
            quota. They think like Homer Simpson in the scene on the right
          </p>

            I will work hard, practice coding regularly, and I will take failure
            as an opportunity to grow.

            I frequently get bogged down in too much of the same information
            when I search for things, so often I&rsquo;ll just see if
            there&rsquo;s a Simple Wikipedia article about it, then go from
            there (Change the beginning of the url from &ldquo;en&rdquo; to
            &ldquo;simple&rdquo;).

            Understanding they&rsquo;re important to neuroplasticity I
            won&rsquo;t let intense study stop me from exercising, socialising
            and sleeper-ising. I will try to maintain the attitude that I can do
            this.
