          <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>When I got blocked on a simple problem</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            At one point I got stuck because I didn&rsquo;t realize you had to
            use square bracket notation on objects when you want to reference
            something inside of them with a variable. I started console logging
            things, but kept getting Undefined, I assigned it to different
            variables, and tested it without the variable to make sure it
            actually contained what I was looking for. Eventually I found the
            answer in a youtube video after googling it. By the end of it I was
            feeling very frustrated because I thought I knew how this worked,
            then I felt rather silly once I figured it out because I actually
            already learned this a few months earlier when I was doing some
            stuff to prepare for this course.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learned I should Google things quicker, instead of just assuming
            I&rsquo;m doing it correctly and I must have mistyped something
            somewhere.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>When I elegantly solved a problem.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            I got stuck for a while on a problem where I had to capitalize every
            word in a given string. I was going to use a for loop to loop
            through the string like an array, and whenever it came across a
            space, make the i+1 positioned letter capitalized. However the task
            said to use the .map method which I&rsquo;ve always had trouble
            with. After writing the problem out on my whiteboard, and discussing
            it with my partner I realized it&rsquo;d be a lot easier if we were
            dealing with an array of words. So I used the split and join methods
            to do just that. I was frustrated when I couldn&rsquo;t test my For
            loop theory but very satisfied once I&rsquo;d sorted out the .split
            and map methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learned how to use the .map method, and that it&rsquo;s better to
            try and do something unfamiliar and learn about it, rather than just
            using what you&rsquo;re used to.
          </p>

              >Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these
              problem-solving techniques/processes:</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Pseudocode</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Not very. I&rsquo;m going to try to do it more, but I&rsquo;ve never
            really used it before this course.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Trying something</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Very, similar to fixing stuff at my old IT job, you just have to try
            stuff.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Rubber ducky method</strong>
          </p>
          <p>So-so. I haven&rsquo;t done this much but I will try this more.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Reading error messages</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Mostly very confidant. I&rsquo;ve had to fix a lot of stuff through
            error messages in my professional life so I know what to look for.
            However Prettier throws me for a loop whenever it starts
            complaining. I can&rsquo;t figure out what any of the ridiculous
            amount of information it throws at me means so I just hit Undo until
            it stops complaining.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Console.logging</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Quite confident. I&rsquo;ve done a fair bit of javascript to prepare
            for this course, and I was using console logging a lot to figure
            stuff out.&nbsp;
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Googling</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Extremely. Most of my previous role in IT was googling stuff to fix
            problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Asking your peers for help</strong>
          </p>
          <p>So-so. I will find this easier once we&rsquo;re in person.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Asking coaches for help</strong>
          </p>
          <p>Quite. I&rsquo;ve asked for help a few times already</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            So-so. I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of changing tasks frequently because
            I find it hard to start focusing on a new thing, when I was really
            into doing the other thing. So stopping to reflect at the moment is
            a bit hard, but I&rsquo;m getting used to it.
