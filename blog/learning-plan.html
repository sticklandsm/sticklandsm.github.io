      A lot of this is stuff I feel like I already answered in the Identity,
      Values, and Strengths blog post so there's going to be a lot of copy and
      pasting. Apologies.<br /><br /><strong

    <p>
      I want to eventually become a software engineer for an established
      company. I would like to have the option to both work in an office and at
      home because I get distracted and stir crazy if I stay home too long.
      Learning web development is a step in the road but I also want to learn
      other languages like python, and Ruby, and how to do SQL stuff. As an ICT
      Technician installing and installing and fixing SQL servers were the bane
      of my existence. So learning that is a big goal.

        >A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>Strengths:</p>
    <p>
      My ability to focus, brought to you by the most Ritalin you legally can
      legally be prescribed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am extremely motivated to complete this course and prove to myself and
      others that I can achieve higher education when given something I'm
      passionate about and the right medication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Programming experience, I've dabbled in this area a lot over the years,
      and I've always enjoyed and been good at it. The previously undiagnosed
      ADHD hampered this dream until now.
    </p>
    <p>Limitations:</p>
    <p>
      Even with the previously mentioned massive amounts of meth(ylphenidate). I
      still find it hard to concentrate for long periods if I'm not doing
      something I'm invested in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hyper focus can be a blessing and a curse. I find it difficult to take the
      5-minute breaks that the Tomato person suggests because once I stop it's
      hard to get back into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The severe ADHD also lends itself to disorganization. I'm innately really
      bad at keeping a schedule, recording my time correctly, and being on time
      for things. Combined with depression which makes it hard to get out bed
      sometimes. I'm pretty on top of all of these problems now due to coping
      methods but there may be the occasional slip up.

      I would like to learn how to work in a team better. All my previous roles
      have been very "Do the work yourself, and no one will bother you as long
      as it's done". I don't have a lot of experience working directly with a
      team.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can have very low mood, which comes across as being a grump. I think
      it's because I was working in roles that I wasn't passionate about, and I
      felt wasn't being respected. I need to not do that. I'm doing this course
      out of want, not necessity so I don't think this will be a problem, but I
      need to be aware of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include:</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm generally kind, personable, and respectful. I will listen and take
      part as much as I can. I'm trying to set goals each day of how long I am
      going to work, in order to keep myself productive.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will ask for help from the staff or let them know I'm struggling at
      least. My partner also used to teach here so I will get a lot of support
      from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely
        way</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      I've learned from experience to not be afraid to ask for help, or tell
      people when I don't understand something. I use to have problems with
      being afraid of looking stupid or that I shouldn't be where I am, but I'm
      aware of it and I mostly don't have this problem anymore.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      I expect them to understand that I don't learn in the exact same way as
      neurotypical people. Often I will pick things up faster than others then
      struggle on concepts which may seem simple. I learn better by doing than
      by taking notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't want any particular special treatment, but some understanding that
      If I'm distracted or late or ill-equipped for something it's not out of
      laziness, or lack of trying.

      I have therapy for an hour on Wednesdays at 11am. I am hoping this doesn't
      cause too many problems. I can maybe see if I can move it if it does.
