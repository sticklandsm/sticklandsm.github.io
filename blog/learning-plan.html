      <strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to get a job as a software developer for an established company. I
      want to be a colleague who is approachable, kind, funny, hard working, and
      knowledgeable. What I end up doing is entirely dependent on what jobs are
      available to me. Everyone has to start somewhere. I use to be the ICT
      Technician for a software company who makes trackable gloves so I&rsquo;m
      going to contact them to see if they&rsquo;d have any openings.

    </p>
    <p>
      Severe inattentive ADHD, I will find it harder than neurotypicals to be
      focused and organized.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand the massive amounts of Ritalin will help me hyper-focus
      on certain things, which is a double edged sword. When I&rsquo;m
      hyper-focused I can work on the same problem for hours without realising
      it. Sometimes this is really good, but sometimes paired with my
      determination (stubbornness) it means I&rsquo;ll waste hours trying to
      make my &ldquo;better&rdquo; solution work when I could have just used the
      obvious solution.

      Being organized and keeping focused for nine weeks. I&rsquo;m not great at
      being on time to things consistently. See severe inattentive ADHD.

    <p>
      Working in a team. I haven&rsquo;t done group projects since high school.
      To be honest I might be really good at it, I just don&rsquo;t know since I
      haven&rsquo;t done it in so long. I generally work best when left to my
      own devices though.
    </p>
    <p>Learning to take breaks would probably be a good idea.</p>
    <p>
      I am self-conscious about specific things. I&rsquo;m not too worried about
      looking stupid anymore so I&rsquo;m happy to ask questions. I get worried
      that I come across as a condescending know-it-all though, so I agonize
      over if I should (and how to) ask things or how to explain things. I would
      like to build confidence there I guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD) is when you experience severe
      emotional pain because of a failure or feeling rejected. This condition is
      linked to ADHD and experts suspect it happens due to differences in brain
      structure. With that said I would like to learn to take criticism better.
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;m trying to quit vaping and biting my nails. This might be the
      wrong course for that though.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I won&rsquo;t do mindfulness meditation or exercises. I&rsquo;ve explained
      why previously.
    </p>
    <p>
      I probably don&rsquo;t have to say this but an understanding that ADHD is
      a real thing, and it&rsquo;s a spectrum on which I&rsquo;m unfortunately
      on the higher end of. I have good coping mechanisms, and medication but
      there may still be times where I can&rsquo;t concentrate or I&rsquo;m
      disorganized. I don&rsquo;t particularly want special treatment but it
      would be nice that it&rsquo;s understood that this stuff is a bit more
      difficult for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;ll google stuff first, then if necessary seek help from my peers,
      and teachers, and my partner who is a senior software engineer who used to
      work at Dev Academy Wellington.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will put partying mostly on hold during boot camp, and try to get the
      right amount of sleep. I&rsquo;m not going to start any new games,
      hobbies, or classes while here. I&rsquo;ll endeavour to be kind,
      respectful and understanding to everyone I meet at Dev Academy. If things
      get to be too much I&rsquo;ll seek help from the people in the above
      paragraph.

    <p>
      A lot of this is stuff I feel like I already answered in the Identity,
      Values, and Strengths blog post so there's going to be a lot of copy and
      pasting. Apologies.<br /><br />

      <strong>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I want to eventually become a software engineer for an established
      company. I would like to have the option to both work in an office and at
      home because I get distracted and stir crazy if I stay home too long.
      Learning web development is a step in the road but I also want to learn
      other languages like python, and Ruby, and how to do SQL stuff. As an ICT
      Technician installing and installing and fixing SQL servers were the bane
      of my existence. So learning that is a big goal.

        >A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>Strengths:</p>
    <p>
      My ability to focus, brought to you by the most Ritalin you legally can
      legally be prescribed.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am extremely motivated to complete this course and prove to myself and
      others that I can achieve higher education when given something I'm
      passionate about and the right medication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Programming experience, I've dabbled in this area a lot over the years,
      and I've always enjoyed and been good at it. The previously undiagnosed
      ADHD hampered this dream until now.
    </p>
    <p>Limitations:</p>
    <p>
      Even with the previously mentioned massive amounts of meth(ylphenidate). I
      still find it hard to concentrate for long periods if I'm not doing
      something I'm invested in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hyper focus can be a blessing and a curse. I find it difficult to take the
      5-minute breaks that the Tomato person suggests because once I stop it's
      hard to get back into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The severe ADHD also lends itself to disorganization. I'm innately really
      bad at keeping a schedule, recording my time correctly, and being on time
      for things. Combined with depression which makes it hard to get out bed
      sometimes. I'm pretty on top of all of these problems now due to coping
      methods but there may be the occasional slip up.

    </p>
    <p>
      I would like to learn how to work in a team better. All my previous roles
      have been very "Do the work yourself, and no one will bother you as long
      as it's done". I don't have a lot of experience working directly with a
      team.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can have very low mood, which comes across as being a grump. I think
      it's because I was working in roles that I wasn't passionate about, and I
      felt wasn't being respected. I need to not do that. I'm doing this course
      out of want, not necessity so I don't think this will be a problem, but I
      need to be aware of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
        This should include:</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm generally kind, personable, and respectful. I will listen and take
      part as much as I can. I'm trying to set goals each day of how long I am
      going to work, in order to keep myself productive.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will ask for help from the staff or let them know I'm struggling at
      least. My partner also used to teach here so I will get a lot of support
      from them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely
        way</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      I've learned from experience to not be afraid to ask for help, or tell
      people when I don't understand something. I use to have problems with
      being afraid of looking stupid or that I shouldn't be where I am, but I'm
      aware of it and I mostly don't have this problem anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong
        >A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</strong
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      I expect them to understand that I don't learn in the exact same way as
      neurotypical people. Often I will pick things up faster than others then
      struggle on concepts which may seem simple. I learn better by doing than
      by taking notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't want any particular special treatment, but some understanding that
      If I'm distracted or late or ill-equipped for something it's not out of
      laziness, or lack of trying.
    </p>
    -Adding this after starting Sprint 3:
    <br />
    I understand that mindfulness and mindful listening exercises are good and
    helpful to most nuerotypical people. I have been pressured to try the
    practice on many different occasions and frankly it only makes things worse
    for me. It's stressful at the best of times and outright panic attack
    inducing at the worst. When I try to make this clear to people they then
    usually respond that nobody's good at it at first, and it just takes
    practice and it's hard but totally worth it. I know they're just trying to
    help, but in my opinion it's pretty ableist to just assume everyones mind
    works the same, and that everyone will benifit from this very specific
    practice that tries to make you do all the things that you've been diagnosed
    as having difficulty doing. To be told that it's just because I didn't try
    hard enough to do it is infuriating. My point is i'm not going to do
    mindfullness exercises. Like an Athiest in a prayer circle I'm fine sitting
    down and checking my emails or listening to a podcast or something instead.

      I have therapy for an hour on Wednesdays at 11am. I am hoping this doesn't
      cause too many problems. I can maybe see if I can move it if it does.
