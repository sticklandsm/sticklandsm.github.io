          <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
          <p>
            Emotional Intelligence is a personâ€™s ability to feel, understand,
            express, and empathize with emotions. EQ is the measurement of that.
            <br />
            <br />
            It is different to IQ in that IQ measures problem solving skills,
            ability to use logic, and general knowledge.
            <br />
            <br />
            Emotional intelligence is important because it generally makes a
            person more pleasant to be around, communicate with, and work with.
            If you can understand and empathize with other people you can
            usually work with them more productively. If you can express your
            emotions in productive rather than destructive ways, then you
            yourself will be understood better.

          <h2>Examples <br /></h2>
          <p>
            Ian has an employee under him who is calling in sick a lot. Using
            his massive IQ he surmises that this employee is lazy and taking
            advantage and fires him. Unfortunately that employee turned out to
            be the fire warden. Using his massive IQ Ian realizes this and
            decides to test if they even need a fire warden via a surprise fire
            drill. Ian is trampled to death in the ensuing chaos.

            <br />
            Eric has an employee under him who is calling in sick a lot. Using
            his massive EQ he talks to the person and though the employee
            insists nothing is wrong, through empathy and kindness Eric learns
            that the employee is being bullied by another employee called Ian
            who thinks that fire wardens are unnecessary. Eric uses his massive
            EQ and realises that simply firing Ian will not fix the problem
            since the idea of unnecessary fire wardens has already been
            implanted in the other staff. Eric uses his not as massive IQ and
            hatches a plan with the employee to call a surprise fire drill,to
            show the importance of fire wardens to the staff. Ian is trampled to
            death in the ensuing chaos.
