              I need to stop being so stubborn by sticking to solutions that
              aren&rsquo;t working or are taking too long to implement. I need
              to remember the sunk cost fallacy.

              I find it quite difficult to write in detail about certain things
              that I just consider common sense, which leads me to frustration.

              I&rsquo;m more determined and patient than I used to be. I would
              have given up a lot sooner when I was younger.

          <p>
            I&rsquo;m not too sure how to answer this question. Empathy and
            self-awareness are important for being a well-rounded individual.
            Having high levels of empathy and self-awareness will make you more
            likeable, and easier to work and learn with. If you can recognize
            what values your peers hold you can better understand them.

            Talking about my values and where they come from was surprisingly
            enlightening.

          <p>
            I find it quite difficult to write in detail about certain things
            that I just consider common sense. Trying to explain why emotional
            intelligence, empathy, etc are important is in my opinion kind of
            like trying to explain why hurting others is bad. I&rsquo;m not
            saying it&rsquo;s not important to understand these things, it
            absolutely is. I just find it difficult to put into words things
            that I mostly just innately feel.

            There are a few reasons I can think of. I imagine you&rsquo;re
            teaching this to us to prepare us for the intensity of in-class
            work, which will probably be an emotional time. You&rsquo;re trying
            to give us tools we can use to keep out mental health in check while
            we navigate changing careers and the challenges that come with that.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&rsquo;ve been working in tech for around 7 years so I know what
            it&rsquo;s like to some extent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Separately from the above, not having the sorts of values
            we&rsquo;ve been talking about doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make you a
            bad programmer, but it does make the industry itself worse. You
            don&rsquo;t want to create another self aggrandizing software
            engineer with a god complex. There&rsquo;s enough sexism, racism,
            elitism, and arrogance in the tech industry already. Making sure
            graduates have an understanding of empathy, emotional intelligence,
            self-awareness etc will hopefully help curb that.

              programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong

            I think certain aspects of it were not super helpful for me
            personally (Mindfulness isn&rsquo;t for everyone). I wouldn&rsquo;t
            say it was a waste of time though. At the very least it&rsquo;s
            always good to take time out for introspection, and programming the
            whole time would have quickly lead to burn out.
