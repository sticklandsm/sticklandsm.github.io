          <h2>JavaScript Fundamentals</h2>
          <p>
            Try to imagine HTML as a mannequin, and CSS as the clothes you put
            on the mannequin. In this analogy JavaScript would be the Christmas
            magic, or Greek muse, or Ancient Egyptian goddess that possesses the
            mannequin and makes it come to life.

          <p>
            While HTML and CSS are important for giving structure and appearance
            to a website, JavaScript is what gives webpages responsiveness and
            interactivity. Pretty much everything you use a webpage for is
            powered by JavaScript, from search boxes, to interactive menus, to
            anything that is animated. Without JavaScript we would just be
            having weird relationships with static, bland, unresponsive dummies.

            <strong>Control flow and Loops</strong>
            <br />
            <br />
            The order in which statements are executed is called the control
            flow. Generally, in JavaScript instructions are run in the order
            they are written, with a few exceptions. For instance a "function"
            can be accessed and run anywhere on the page even if it’s described
            later on. If you were doing the dishes by hand, “Run dish under
            water” might be a function that you want call a few times.
            Establishing that function by staying by the sink would allow you to
            do that at any point during the process.
            <br />
            <br />
            Looping is a process by which you repeat a process a certain amount
            of times. Using the earlier example of doing the dishes, when
            washing a frying pan you may need to scrub the pan, rinse the pan,
            see if there&rsquo;s more gunk on there, then repeat a few times. In
            Javascript that might look something like this:
          </p>
          <p>
            While (pan is still dirty){<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
            &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Scrub pan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
            &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;rinse pan<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
            &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;check if pan is still dirty<br />&nbsp;}<br />&nbsp;return
            pan
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>The DOM</strong> <br />
            <br />
            The DOM (Document Object Model) is the way in which JavaScript
            interacts with HTML and CSS. The DOM breaks the HTML into objects
            within objects which we can then reference and change using
            JavaScript. For example every HTML document should have a
            &lt;body&gt; tag, therefore we could use JavaScript to grab that
            body (and everything within it) and turn the website&rsquo;s
            background blue like so:
          </p>
          <p>document.body.style.backgroundColor = &quot;blue&quot;;</p>
          <p>
            As the DOM puts everything into objects, not Arrays we would be
            using dot notation (document.body) to access it, not square bracket
            notation (array[0])
          </p>
          <p>
            In conclusion, JavaScript is truly a land of contrasts.
