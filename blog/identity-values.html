      There was a situation where I was trying to help a client move the
      companies finance database from their current computer, to their new
      computer. It was literally on a single computer, not on a server, or the
      cloud. The problem was I didn't know anything about this
      software/database. I had to figure out how to use the software first of
      all in order to be able to work out how to export the database somewhere
      else. We were told that if a problem takes longer than an hour we should
      escalate it to someone with more experience. This rule doesn't work
      in practice with problems like this because no one knows how this software
      works. This caused tension with my team because I had to spend so long on
      this one project. After many, many hours I just ended up copying and
      pasting the whole application and the database over to the shared file
      server, then onto their new computer. It all seemed to be working so I
      signed off for the day. A month later the director of the company called
      us, furious, because I had accidentally left a copy of the database in the
      IT folder on the shared sever which in theory anyone could access. Even
      though the database was password protected when going through the
      software, the actual files could just be opened in Excel if you dug into
      the folder far enough. Bad program. Do not recommend. Still my fault
      though.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was an ethical question because at the very start I could have told
      the client that we're not going to help with that part. I would have
      been in the right, and I would also gain a lot of spare time by not doing
      it. But I knew that it would be a nightmare for this person to try to
      contact this massive finance company and try to explain what their issue
      was. They would probably give up and go back to their old computer, which
      will eventually fail, and lead to bigger problems like people not getting
      paid on time. I still don't know if I made the right decision to
      help.

      I have severe ADHD-I (I = Inattentive type) that was only recently
      diagnosed In 2020. I've been a C student my whole life. Studying,
      and homework, and assignments were very difficult but I got through based
      on what I absorbed in the classroom. There's a common pattern where
      adults will put special interest into kids with ADHD because it seems like
      if they just put in more effort, did the homework, the assignments,
      studied more, then they would be top of the class. When this doesn't
      work out, the kid is accused of being lazy, unmotivated, disobedient etc.
      This pattern can occur over and over well into adulthood. Eventually that
      kid will start believing those descriptors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's a fun twitter thread which goes over that pattern in more
      detail:

    </p>
    <p>
      Despite me being diagnosed, and medicated now, that pattern has shaped who
      I am and has heavily affected my values.

      My signature strengths according to some online quizzes are Kindness,
      Love, Humor, Perspective, Social Intelligence, and Hufflepuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strengths I'm supposedly weakest in are Hope, Zest,
      Spirituality, Self-Regulation, and Hufflepuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think this is reasonably accurate and kind of funny. My friends have
      described me as Eeyore from Winnie the Pooh on more than one occasion so
      lacking Hope and Zest makes sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's difficult to value what I see as the productive strengths
      (Creativity, Perseverance, Love of Learning etc) when it's been
      drilled into you that you're lazy, unmotivated and a waste of
      potential from a young age.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ADHD diagnosis, medication, and therapy has caused me to mostly no
      longer believe those things about myself. I failed out of University 3
      separate times when I was younger. Coasting on classroom learning
      didn't work when I got there. I went back in 2021 (after getting
      Ritalin'd up) to do a couple of papers after lockdown and got
      straight A's. I am proud of this achievement but I didn't
      enjoy my time there. It made me realize that traditional university
      isn't for me at the moment.
    </p>
    <p>My actual strengths which I think will help with this journey are:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
      <li>
        My ability to focus, brought to you by the most Ritalin you can be
        prescribed in NZ.
      </li>
      <li>
        Problem solving skills, I've been working in consumer IT for 7
        years so I have instincts for how to fix weird things. I've worked
        for 2 wildly different software development companies as an ICT
        Technician.
      </li>
      <li>
        Programming experience, I've dabbled in this area a lot over the
        years, and I've always enjoyed and it and been good at it.
      </li>

    </p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc">
      <li>
        Even with the previously mentioned massive amounts of meth(ylphenidate).
        I still find it hard to concentrate if I'm not doing something
        I'm interested in.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hyper focus can be a blessing and a curse. I find it difficult to take
        the 5-minute breaks that the Tomato person suggests because once I stop
        it's hard to get back into it.
      </li>
      <li>
        ADHD also lends itself to disorganization. I'm innately really bad
        at keeping a schedule, recording my time correctly, and being on time
        for things. Combined with depression which makes it hard to get out bed
        sometimes.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I've learned to deal with these problems through vigilance, and
      various coping methods and strategies. For example if I have a meeting or
      something to do later, I will write it down immediately in my calendar or
      reminder app or else I will not remember it. Still sometimes I ironically
      forget to write it down and it slips through the cracks.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can be stubborn when it comes to fixing problems. &nbsp; I prefer to
      work at something until I've fixed it, and I sometimes struggle to
      ask for help partly because of hyper-focus and partly ego. I always tell
      myself that by the time I've explained what the problem is in
      detail, and what I've already tried, I probably could have fixed it.
      This happened a lot in my previous job.&nbsp;
